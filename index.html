<DL>
	<DT>This will be a long review so if you don't want to waste that
	much time, then just read the tl;dr at the very top. It will be
	setup in the following order. Graphics, Audio, Gameplay, Story, and
	a final paragraph paraphrasing things that I've said previously.
	Also, I will list the things that I dislike about it in each section
	before I list the things that I like.<DT>

<DL>
	<DT><P><FONT SIZE=3>If you've got a 360, and are looking for a
	really fun game, plus you have a HDD with 7.5GiB of space definitely
	get this game. It has a few minor issues here and there, but all
	games do. This is nothing like New Vegas when it first came out, and
	any issues that I've had were extremely minor. Also remember that
	whilst playing it I was looking for things that I'd dislike about it
	and attempting to find things wrong with the game.</FONT><DT><P>

<BR>
<DL>
	<DT><P><FONT SIZE=3>The actual review below, as warned above it is
	quite a lot to read. It current comes in at words. I have covered
	quite a few things, and everyone who knows me, knows that I rarely
	speak quickly about nothing. I like to go in depth, and talk about
	things that caught my interest for whatever reason. I have done
	this, with this game. It is also entirely text, so if you do not
	like reading a bunch of text, then don't read it. My feelings won't
	be hurt, and it's not like I expect many to read this due to its
	length alone, not including the fact that I am almost unknown in any
	realm of reviewers and thus have no “street cred” with which to
	throw behind my opinions. Which these are, they are nothing more
	than that, and take them for what they are. I have tried to include
	facts about the various small things with the game that I dislike,
	but yours may be different. It'd honestly surprise me if they were
	not. With that said, I'll start the review now since I've already
	used plenty enough words on this introduction.</FONT><DT><P>
	<BR>
</DL>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=6><B>GRAPHICS</B></FONT><P ALIGN=CENTER>
<BR>
<DL>
	<DT><P><FONT SIZE=3>I've only played the game with it installed to
	my HDD, so I have no idea how it's going to look if you don't do
	that. Thus, anything I say about how the textures look, will only
	relate to how they look if you've installed it to your harddrive.
	From what I've been able to gather  that's the only thing that
	changes beyond quicker load times from installing it.</FONT><DT><P>
	<BR>
	<DT><P><FONT SIZE=3>For reference, my computer that I played the
	game on, was able to play the game at ultra quality with 30fps, and
	thus I'm comparing the graphical quality of the game world on the
	360 to that. Sure some may say that's not fair, but I care not,
	since this is their engine on the 360, but it's the same people and
	it's their first foray into the 360 marketplace and one would think
	that they'd like to make a good first impression.</FONT><DT><P>
	<BR>
	<DT><P><FONT SIZE=3>And how they have! Very few textures in the game
	world seem to be stretched beyond how big they should be, I even
	walked up extremely close to them to make sure. They have really
	done a good job on making the textures still work with such anemic
	hardware. The primary time that you notice that the textures aren't
	as big as they should be, is on characters. When you get really
	close in on them, they're a bit blurry.... But that is something to
	be expected considering the draw distance in the game world.</FONT><DT><P>
	<BR>
	<DT><P><FONT SIZE=3>The draw distance is about half of what it was
	on my laptop, it's not exactly mind blowing if you're comparing it
	to a high-end PC but if you're comparing it to the other 360 games
	it simply is amazing. There is almost no “fog” that is shown on
	the edge of the horizons. The trees and other flora seem to be 
	about the level of polygons that you'd expect. They're not
	noticeably bad, but they could be higher. Most of the time though, I
	barely noticed it since the game drew me in so well.</FONT><DT><P>
	<BR>
	<DT><P><FONT SIZE=3>Texures popping into the scene were shown, it
	only ever happened in cut scenes and when you first load up the
	game. During the cutscenes it was mostly where the cutscene took
	place outdoors in a large open area. When loading up the game, they
	go from “extremely low” to “good”, in the cutscene though
	sometimes it goes from “extremely low” to “ugly”. If the
	textures look like they do when I first load up the game, then my
	god... you better install this game, the game will look god awful...
	the texrtures really make it in this game.</FONT><DT><P>
	<BR>
	<DT><P> <FONT SIZE=3>The animations of the characters, mobs, and
	others inside of the game world are really nice. There wasn't any
	herky-jerky action anywhere to be seen. Overall I applaud their
	mocap team and the animators for polishing those animations.</FONT><DT><P>
	<BR>
</DL>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=6><B>AUDIO</B></FONT><P ALIGN=CENTER>
<BR>
<DL>
	<DT><P><FONT SIZE=3>There is only one issue that I had with the
	audio inside of the game. During cutscenes the talking can be
	drowned out by the ambient noise and other music. Most of the time
	it's Geralt. Also, during battles the sounds of the things you're
	fighting especially the harpies can be deafening. Even when I turned
	it way down(at 5/10). </FONT>
	<DT><P><BR>
	<DT><P><FONT SIZE=3>The sound effects in the game are varied enough
	so that they never become annoying to listen to. They also seem to
	fit really well with the visuals that are portrayed. Just, as stated
	previously, they can be a bit overpowering to the rest of the sounds
	in battle.</FONT><DT><P>
	<BR>
	<DT><P><FONT SIZE=3>The game's score is very varied and also is
	unique enough to never become annoying. One of the most annoying
	things that I encounter in some games, is where the musical
	soundtrack is repeated on a loop where the music is less than 30
	seconds long and it's very noticeable. Here, I never really minded
	when the music looped around again, and each area had a score that
	seemed to fit the scene. </FONT>
	<DT><P><BR>
</DL>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=6><B>GAMEPLAY</B></FONT><P ALIGN=CENTER>
<BR>
<DL>
	<DT><P><FONT SIZE=3>QTEs, you hate them. I hate them, everyone with
	any semblance of a brain hates them. I've got bad news and good news
	for you. The bad news is that this game has them, since apparently
	the designers think that users love these god awful mechanics. The
	good news is that you can turn them off. The way to get them is as
	follows, this assumes that you're on the title screen.
	Options-&gt;Gameplay-&gt;Uncheck Difficult QTEs. Trust me you will
	want to turn them off, unless you like replaying the same scene
	dozens of times on end.</FONT><DT><P>
	<BR>
	<DT><P><FONT SIZE=3>The game also has QTEs in optional areas or well
	areas where you'd expect them, this is in fights but they give you
	enough of a buffer to actually use them properly. You have to press
	a button, or sometimes press a button and then hit another one.
	Overall it's not overly challenging, and is a nice effect since it's
	used sparingly. There are other optional things that you may do that
	have little effect on the game's main story too.</FONT><DT><P>
	<BR>
	<DT><P><FONT SIZE=3>The other main event is “Dice Poker.” This
	game has changed since the first game, and if you ask me for the
	worst. It plays like poker, but you have no idea what the symbols
	mean and who has the better hand. Also they force you to “roll”
	the dice instead of just pressing a button. This is annoying and
	does nothing for me. In the first game, it'd show you what your hand
	was and what the hand of the person you were facing was. They don't
	even include what the symbols mean, so that you can know which are
	the numbers from 1-6. The tutorial on this is pointless as it
	doesn't tell you anything of poker. Unless you know poker have fun.</FONT><DT><P>
	<BR>
	<DT><P><FONT SIZE=3>The combat this time around has been streamlined
	as far as core combat goes. But to counteract this, they've added
	more things to the game. The first game you had three combat styles,
	and you had to change through them to be able to handle the game.
	There was fast, strong, and group style. Now they've done away with
	group style and instead are using traps to take place of crowd
	control. Alchemy is still here, and is expanded into bombs, beyond
	just oils for your blades, and potions, and maybe thrown items.</FONT><DT><P>
	<BR>
	<DT><P><FONT SIZE=3>I didn't use any of the daggers that they gave
	you beyond the tutorial, it looked really interesting, but I wasn't
	about to waste that talent point. Their damage is very high and will
	be very well used by anyone who wants to use that talent point.
	Towards the end of the game a single thrown projectile will yield
	twice the damage that you sword is able to do. These are great for
	enemies that are far away for you... but when they get closer... you
	better have traps set up. </FONT>
	<DT><P><BR>
	<DT><P><FONT SIZE=3>The traps are absolutely needed to get through
	this game, now, you can use the trap that comes with your magic. You
	will have to use it, and it will definitely help you, and is needed
	at the very least.  Most fights you will not have to use it, but
	later on especially in boss fights you will have to use it. If you
	do not, you'll likely fail very quickly. Even if you have potions
	activated, your blades oiled, and ready for battle. I've not used
	the actual crafted traps since I didn't feel like using them and
	thus cannot talk about how well they all work, but alchemy will be
	required regardless of your difficulty.</FONT><DT><P>
	<BR>
	<DT><P><FONT SIZE=3>Potions this time around are about the same as
	they used to be, but the only thing that is extremely annoying is
	that the developers only let you have 3 potions taken as a maximum,
	and the skills that act like you can drink more are lying. It does
	nothing and is stupid. I liked the old options, wherein you had the
	option to drink as many as you wanted, and you also could mix it
	with alcoholic drinks to make more potent potions. Now, the alchemy
	this time around has changed to also include bombs as a more
	prevalent option inside of the game world and especially the story.</FONT><DT><P>
	<BR>
	<DT><P><FONT SIZE=3>The bombs inside of the game, are much more
	varied and are more akin to the oils that you put on your blades in
	the previous game, with various ones for mobs that are much more
	powerful than the standard one but are also varied enough to keep
	the strategies interesting. You will have to make a few to progress
	through the story, but beyond that I didn't use them past the
	tutorial/what I came across in the game.</FONT><DT><P>
	<BR>
	<DT><P><FONT SIZE=3>Information about the mobs is no longer just
	given to you quickly, it is instead of just being shown to you. You
	have to dig through information in the glossary to figure out what
	the mobs weakness was. It used to be that you just found out and it
	was just there, now they've hidden it more deeply. This wasn't a
	huge issue but to get to it, required a shitton of actions on my
	part. It'd have been nicer to just have them more easily accessible.</FONT><DT><P>
	<BR>
	<DT><P><FONT SIZE=3>The skills this time around, are just skill
	points. Unlike the previous game wherein you  had to use skill
	points, that were of various qualities to get them working. Now it's
	simply, allocate a talent and get that skill and you can upgrade it
	through its levels. It's way more streamlined this time around, and
	this is both good and bad. It's good because it's easier to manage
	but it's bad because it didn't feel like I was as   pushed hard for
	the talent points. You have to meditate to allocate these points, or
	any of the major things.</FONT><DT><P>
	<BR>
	<DT><P><FONT SIZE=3>This time around meditation is much more
	streamlined. You used to have to look for a campfire or a fire of
	any time to take time out to do these things. Now you can do it
	anywhere, which is very nice and allows you to take the game easier.
	Now this isn't always true since they do like to throw you into
	fights without any preparations or make make it so that your potions
	expire. But it's still making the game much easier for those who
	need that. Alchemy creation is also much faster, but is also a bit
	more annoying. You have to hold onto all formulas instead of letting
	you just memorize them and discard them. This becomes apparent when
	you look at the weight you can carry.</FONT><DT><P>
	<BR>
	<DT><P><FONT SIZE=3>Inventory this time around is much more
	organized than it was previously, and makes finding things much
	easier. The only downside is that you have to carry formulas which
	all have a weight 0.1 pounds. The crafting components are of various
	weights which isn't a huge deal. But it can come out of no where and
	make you have that message of “you are carrying too much weight.”,
	and it flashes, and also you walk slowly but beyond that that's all
	it does. So it's mostly just there to annoy you apparently.</FONT><DT><P>
	<BR>
	<DT><P><FONT SIZE=3>With all of that said, there's little more that
	I can say about the gameplay, all that's left is the story, which is
	similarly going to take quite a lot of writing to talk about it.</FONT><DT><P>
	<BR>
</DL>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=6><B>STORY</B></FONT><P ALIGN=CENTER>
<BR>
<DL>
	<DT><P><FONT SIZE=3>The story this time around is just as strong as
	it was previously. To start off, the developers didn't seem to take
	a lot of information from the previous game, and then tie it into
	the previous game. This is disappointing to say the least, and I
	would've liked for them to include more of the story from the
	previous game. When I played it on my PC, there was little taken
	from the previous game. This is annoying to say the least, and makes
	it feel like those who have previously played the game. The least
	they could've done is to explain away why none of those characters
	even make an appearance inside of the this story. Now with the bad
	done, it's time to move on to the good.</FONT><DT><P>
	<BR>
	<DT><P><FONT SIZE=3>The story starts off very strongly, and is a
	nice tutorial in and of itself. The story is kind of overly-huge and
	kind of generic in and of itself but it doesn't last long. It picks
	up very quickly. There are quite a few paths that you can take as
	you go through the game and each of them is very fulfilling. But
	once again, there is bad here. In the previous game you could be
	completely neutral, this one though... that is impossible. You will
	be one path or the other more. So no matter how much you want to
	it's impossible. </FONT>
	<DT><P><BR>
	<DT><P><FONT SIZE=3>The number of branches that you have inside of
	this game is extreme to say the least, there are many paths and you
	could very likely play through the game a dozen times without having
	the exact same story. I don't know how many endings there are but
	there is many places wherein the story could diverge. Even if it
	does come back together, there are different versions that are
	apparent. The story was very enjoyable and really helped to mask any
	flaws that are in this game. Without such a strong story, the game
	would've just been the same old fantasy game with realistic graphics
	and a nice score, but the story helps put it over the tipping point
	that lands this game as one that is truly awesome and deserving of
	your purchase.</FONT><DT><P>
	<BR>
	<DT><P><FONT SIZE=3>I know I promised to say more about the story,
	but it is extremely hard to say anything more about it without
	revealing spoilers that will detract from your own playing
	experience. The voice acting is also really well written, and does
	not detract from the rest of the game. I didn't even notice that the
	game was originally written in a language that is nothing like the
	langauge I played it in, which is english. The translators and
	localizers are very talented and really help make this game feel
	really nice.</FONT><DT><P>
	<BR>
</DL>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=6><B>GENERAL</B></FONT><P ALIGN=CENTER>
<BR>
<DL>
	<DT><P><FONT SIZE=3>Now I'll just summarize various thoughts of the
	game, from a company that has made it big by treating their
	customers properly. If you're still not convinced to play this game
	by now, then there is nothing else I can do to convince you. The
	game is really fun, and I'm likely going to replay the game very
	soon. I never play a game again from the beginning after beating it,
	except when there is a “new game plus” that is completely
	different from the actual game, but this time. I think that I will. </FONT>
	<DT><P><BR>
	<DT><P><FONT SIZE=3>The game has a lot of minor issues that weren't
	previously talked about, so I'm going to list them here. When going
	through the menus, IE the inventory and other such ones, and even in
	shops. The screen will flash black, this is extremely annoying but I
	guess you get used to it. Also the game shows the “Autosaving”
	animation even though it's just “writing to the cache” and it
	won't let you save during this time either. So, let's say you have a
	weird crash, well I hope you saved recently, because you cannot
	count on the autosave, since it lies. You have no idea when it's
	autosaving or just writing to its caches, which is a wondrous thing
	that the developers have done. You know that have that icon that
	shows loading, why they don't use that? Fuck if I know. All I know
	is, it's lost me up to ten minutes of my time. </FONT>
	<DT><P><BR>
	<DT><P><FONT SIZE=3>With the bad things taken out of the way, the
	game's startup isn't as long as others. But it's still unskippable
	as are all intros on all of these games. I don't know why they
	refuse to let you do it if you've already saved, but whatever.
	Overall I'd say this game is definitely worth playing, but you
	better have a hard drive to install it on that has at least 15GiB of
	storage space left on it. If not, I have no idea what to say to you,
	since the loading times with it installed are minor, and are really
	quick. Most of the time I cannot read the text on the little blurbs,
	but that still doesn't mean that they'll always be that way if
	you're playing off of the disc, and I honestly expect it to not be
	your experience.</FONT><DT><P>
	<BR>
	<DT><P><FONT SIZE=3>Final conclusion, is to buy this game either for
	the 360 or the PC. If you don't have a powerful PC, and you have a
	360 get it for the 360. Either way, you'll be looking for a really
	fun time. The differences between the two are minor and either way
	you'll have a lot of fun. I think it took me ~40-50hrs to beat this
	game the first time through. I didn't play on anything but medium,
	so higher difficulties will likely take you longer. But either way,
	its' a long experience that doesn't leave you yearning for more. It
	ties up most things really well. The only thing I wish, is for the
	next game in the series to be in the making or damn near it. Since I
	look forward to it, the amount of content in here is more than
	enough for the price and the included extras simply put it over the
	top. Support this company, since they're one of, if the only big
	name developers who really care about their customers.</FONT></DL>
